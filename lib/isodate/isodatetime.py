This module defines a method to parse an ISO 8601:2004 date time string.

For this job it uses the parse_date and parse_time methods defined in date
and time module.
'''
from datetime import datetime

from isodate.isostrf import strftime
from isodate.isostrf import DATE_EXT_COMPLETE, TIME_EXT_COMPLETE, TZ_EXT
from isodate.isodates import parse_date
from isodate.isotime import parse_time

def parse_datetime(datetimestring):
    '''
    Parses ISO 8601 date-times into datetime.datetime objects.
    
    This function uses parse_date and parse_time to do the job, so it allows
    more combinations of date and time representations, than the actual
    ISO 8601:2004 standard allows.
    '''
    datestring, timestring = datetimestring.split('T')
    tmpdate = parse_date(datestring)
    tmptime = parse_time(timestring)
    return datetime.combine(tmpdate, tmptime)

    '''
    Format datetime strings. 
    
    This method is just a wrapper around isodate.isostrf.strftime and uses
    Extended-Complete as default format.

    return strftime(tdt, format)
