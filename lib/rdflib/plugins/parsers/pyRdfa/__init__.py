"""
RDFa 1.1 parser, also referred to as a “RDFa Distiller”. It is
deployed, via a CGI front-end, on the U{W3C RDFa 1.1 Distiller page<http://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/>}.

For details on RDFa, the reader should consult the U{RDFa Core 1.1<http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/>}, U{XHTML+RDFa1.1<http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/xhtml-rdfa>}, and the U{RDFa 1.1 Lite<http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/>} documents.
The U{RDFa 1.1 Primer<http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/>} may also prove helpful.

This package can also be downloaded U{from GitHub<https://github.com/RDFLib/pyrdfa3>}. The
distribution also includes the CGI front-end and a separate utility script to be run locally.

Note that this package is an updated version of a U{previous RDFa distiller<http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa>} that was developed
for RDFa 1.0. Although it reuses large portions of that code, it has been quite thoroughly rewritten, hence put in a completely
different project. (The version numbering has been continued, though, to avoid any kind of misunderstandings. This version has version numbers "3.0.0" or higher.)

(Simple) Usage
==============
From a Python file, expecting a Turtle output::
 from pyRdfa import pyRdfa
 print pyRdfa().rdf_from_source('filename')
Other output formats are also possible. E.g., to produce RDF/XML output, one could use::
 from pyRdfa import pyRdfa
 print pyRdfa().rdf_from_source('filename', outputFormat='pretty-xml')
It is also possible to embed an RDFa processing. Eg, using::
 from pyRdfa import pyRdfa
 graph = pyRdfa().graph_from_source('filename')
returns an RDFLib.Graph object instead of a serialization thereof. See the the description of the
L{pyRdfa class<pyRdfa.pyRdfa>} for further possible entry points details.

There is also, as part of this module, a L{separate entry for CGI calls<processURI>}.

Return (serialization) formats
------------------------------

The package relies on RDFLib. By default, it relies therefore on the serializers coming with the local RDFLib distribution. However, there has been some issues with serializers of older RDFLib releases; also, some output formats, like JSON-LD, are not (yet) part of the standard RDFLib distribution. A companion package, called pyRdfaExtras, is part of the download, and it includes some of those extra serializers. The extra format (not part of the RDFLib core) is U{JSON-LD<http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-syntax/>}, whose 'key' is 'json', when used in the 'parse' method of an RDFLib graph.

Options
=======

The package also implements some optional features that are not part of the RDFa recommendations. At the moment these are:

 - possibility for plain literals to be normalized in terms of white spaces. Default: false. (The RDFa specification requires keeping the white spaces and leave applications to normalize them, if needed)
 - inclusion of embedded RDF: Turtle content may be enclosed in a C{script} element and typed as C{text/turtle}, U{defined by the RDF Working Group<http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/>}. Alternatively, some XML dialects (e.g., SVG) allows the usage of RDF/XML as part of their core content to define metadata in RDF. For both of these cases pyRdfa parses these serialized RDF content and adds the resulting triples to the output Graph. Default: true.
 - extra, built-in transformers are executed on the DOM tree prior to RDFa processing (see below). These transformers can be provided by the end user.
 
Options are collected in an instance of the L{Options} class and may be passed to the processing functions as an extra argument. E.g., to allow the inclusion of embedded content::
 from pyRdfa.options import Options
 options = Options(embedded_rdf=True)
 print pyRdfa(options=options).rdf_from_source('filename')
 
See the description of the L{Options} class for the details.


Host Languages
==============

RDFa 1.1. Core is defined for generic XML; there are specific documents to describe how the generic specification is applied to
XHTML and HTML5.

pyRdfa makes an automatic switch among these based on the content type of the source as returned by an HTTP request. The following are the
possible host languages:
 - if the content type is C{text/html}, the content is HTML5
 - if the content type is C{application/xhtml+xml} I{and} the right DTD is used, the content is XHTML1
 - if the content type is C{application/xhtml+xml} and no or an unknown DTD is used, the content is XHTML5
 - if the content type is C{application/svg+xml}, the content type is SVG
 - if the content type is C{application/atom+xml}, the content type is SVG
 - if the content type is C{application/xml} or C{application/xxx+xml} (but 'xxx' is not 'atom' or 'svg'), the content type is XML

If local files are used, pyRdfa makes a guess on the content type based on the file name suffix: C{.html} is for HTML5, C{.xhtml} for XHTML1, C{.svg} for SVG, anything else is considered to be general XML. Finally, the content type may be set by the caller when initializing the L{pyRdfa class<pyRdfa.pyRdfa>}.

Beyond the differences described in the RDFa specification, the main difference is the parser used to parse the source. In the case of HTML5, pyRdfa uses an U{HTML5 parser<http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/>}; for all other cases the simple XML parser, part of the core Python environment, is used. This may be significant in the case of erronuous sources: indeed, the HTML5 parser may do adjustments on
the DOM tree before handing it over to the distiller. Furthermore, SVG is also recognized as a type that allows embedded RDF in the form of RDF/XML.

See the variables in the L{host} module if a new host language is added to the system. The current host language information is available for transformers via the option argument, too, and can be used to control the effect of the transformer.

Vocabularies
============

RDFa 1.1 has the notion of vocabulary files (using the C{@vocab} attribute) that may be used to expand the generated RDF graph. Expansion is based on some very simply RDF Schema and OWL statements on sub-properties and sub-classes, and equivalences.

pyRdfa implements this feature, although it does not do this by default. The extra C{vocab_expansion} parameter should be used for this extra step, for example::
 from pyRdfa.options import Options
 options = Options(vocab_expansion=True)
 print pyRdfa(options=options).rdf_from_source('filename')

The triples in the vocabulary files themselves (i.e., the small ontology in RDF Schema and OWL) are removed from the result, leaving the inferred property and type relationships only (additionally to the “core” RDF content).

Vocabulary caching
------------------

By default, pyRdfa uses a caching mechanism instead of fetching the vocabulary files each time their URI is met as a C{@vocab} attribute value. (This behavior can be switched off setting the C{vocab_cache} option to false.) 

Caching happens in a file system directory. The directory itself is determined by the platform the tool is used on, namely:
 - On Windows, it is the C{pyRdfa-cache} subdirectory of the C{%APPDATA%} environment variable
 - On MacOS, it is the C{~/Library/Application Support/pyRdfa-cache}
 - Otherwise, it is the C{~/.pyRdfa-cache}
 
This automatic choice can be overridden by the C{PyRdfaCacheDir} environment variable. 

Caching can be set to be read-only, i.e., the setup might generate the cache files off-line instead of letting the tool writing its own cache when operating, e.g., as a service on the Web. This can be achieved by making the cache directory read only. 

If the directories are neither readable nor writable, the vocabulary files are retrieved via HTTP every time they are hit. This may slow down processing, it is advised to avoid such a setup for the package.

The cache includes a separate index file and a file for each vocabulary file. Cache control is based upon the C{EXPIRES} header of a vocabulary file’s HTTP return header: when first seen, this data is stored in the index file and controls whether the cache has to be renewed or not. If the HTTP return header does not have this entry, the date is artificially set ot the current date plus one day.

(The cache files themselves are dumped and loaded using U{Python’s built in cPickle package<http://docs.python.org/release/2.7/library/pickle.html#module-cPickle>}. These are binary files. Care should be taken if they are managed by CVS: they must be declared as binary files when adding them to the repository.)

RDFa 1.1 vs. RDFa 1.0
=====================

Unfortunately, RDFa 1.1 is I{not} fully backward compatible with RDFa 1.0, meaning that, in a few cases, the triples generated from an RDFa 1.1 source are not the same as for RDFa 1.0. (See the separate  U{section in the RDFa 1.1 specification<http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/#major-differences-with-rdfa-syntax-1.0>} for some further details.)

This distiller’s default behavior is RDFa 1.1. However, if the source includes, in the top element of the file (e.g., the C{html} element) a C{@version} attribute whose value contains the C{RDFa 1.0} string, then the distiller switches to a RDFa 1.0 mode. (Although the C{@version} attribute is not required in RDFa 1.0, it is fairly commonly used.) Similarly, if the RDFa 1.0 DTD is used in the XHTML source, it will be taken into account (a very frequent setup is that an XHTML file is defined with that DTD and is served as text/html; pyRdfa will consider that file as XHTML5, i.e., parse it with the HTML5 parser, but interpret the RDFa attributes under the RDFa 1.0 rules).

Transformers
============

The package uses the concept of 'transformers': the parsed DOM tree is possibly
transformed I{before} performing the real RDFa processing. This transformer structure makes it possible to
add additional 'services' without distoring the core code of RDFa processing.

A transformer is a function with three arguments:

 - C{node}: a DOM node for the top level element of the DOM tree
 - C{options}: the current L{Options} instance
 - C{state}: the current L{ExecutionContext} instance, corresponding to the top level DOM Tree element

The function may perform any type of change on the DOM tree; the typical behaviour is to add or remove attributes on specific elements. Some transformations are included in the package and can be used as examples; see the L{transform} module of the distribution. These are:

 - The C{@name} attribute of the C{meta} element is copied into a C{@property} attribute of the same element
 - Interpreting the 'openid' references in the header. See L{transform.OpenID} for further details.
 - Implementing the Dublin Core dialect to include DC statements from the header.  See L{transform.DublinCore} for further details.

The user of the package may refer add these transformers to L{Options} instance. Here is a possible usage with the “openid” transformer added to the call::
 from pyRdfa.options import Options
 from pyRdfa.transform.OpenID import OpenID_transform
 options = Options(transformers=[OpenID_transform])
 print pyRdfa(options=options).rdf_from_source('filename')
 

@summary: RDFa parser (distiller)
@requires: Python version 2.5 or up; 2.7 is preferred
@requires: U{RDFLib<http://rdflib.net>}; version 3.X is preferred.
@requires: U{html5lib<http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/>} for the HTML5 parsing.
@requires: U{httpheader<http://deron.meranda.us/python/httpheader/>}; however, a small modification had to make on the original file, so for this reason and to make distribution easier this module (single file) is added to the package.

	 - C{space_preserve=[true|false]} means that plain literals are normalized in terms of white spaces. Default: C{false}
	 - C{rfa_version} provides the RDFa version that should be used for distilling. The string should be of the form "1.0" or "1.1". Default is the highest version the current package implements, currently "1.1"
	 - C{host_language=[xhtml,html,xml]} : the host language. Used when files are uploaded or text is added verbatim, otherwise the HTTP return header should be used. Default C{xml}
	 - C{embedded_rdf=[true|false]} : whether embedded turtle or RDF/XML content should be added to the output graph. Default: C{false}
	 - C{vocab_expansion=[true|false]} : whether the vocabularies should be expanded through the restricted RDFS entailment. Default: C{false}
	 - C{vocab_cache=[true|false]} : whether vocab caching should be performed or whether it should be ignored and vocabulary files should be picked up every time. Default: C{false}
	 - C{vocab_cache_report=[true|false]} : whether vocab caching details should be reported. Default: C{false}
	 - C{vocab_cache_bypass=[true|false]} : whether vocab caches have to be regenerated every time. Default: C{false}
	 - C{rdfa_lite=[true|false]} : whether warnings should be generated for non RDFa Lite attribute usage. Default: C{false}
