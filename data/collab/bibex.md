The W3C [Schema Bib Extend](http://www.w3.org/community/schemabibex/) (BibEx) group led the work to improve schema.org for bibliographic information, including terms for periodicals, articles and multi-volume works. The design was inspired in places (e.g. [[pageStart]], [[pageEnd]], [[pagination]]) by the [Bibliographic Ontology](http://bibliontology.com/), 'bibo'.
