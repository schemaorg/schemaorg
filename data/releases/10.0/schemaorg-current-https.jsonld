The simplest use of <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.<br/><br/>\n\n2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/cssSelector\">cssSelector</a> property.<br/><br/>\n\n3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/xpath\">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this\nwe define a supporting type, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification\">SpeakableSpecification</a>  which is defined to be a possible value of the <em>speakable</em> property.",

In\n      the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.\n      Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\".<br/><br/>\n\nOpen-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date.

      "rdfs:comment": "A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update\n      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a\n      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,\n      local government.<br/><br/>\n\nFor work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#\">this doc</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nThe motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic\">Coronavirus pandemic</a>, and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org\nexpect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our\nusual <a href=\"https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490\">Github entry</a>, feedback comments can also be provided in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#\">this document</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nWhile this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol\">CAP</a>, although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover\nthe kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.<br/><br/>\n\nSeveral kinds of information can be provided:<br/><br/>\n\nWe encourage the provision of \"name\", \"text\", \"datePosted\", \"expires\" (if appropriate), \"category\" and\n\"url\" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for \"category\" where possible, most ideally as a well known\nURL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic\" or \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910\".<br/><br/>\n\nFor many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/WebContent\">WebContent</a> type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple \"<a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/text\">text</a>\" summary of the page. It is\nunlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.<br/><br/>\n\nWe expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/openingHours\">openingHours</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/Event\">Event</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/FAQPage\">FAQPage</a> etc. By linking to those pages from a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement\">SpecialAnnouncement</a> you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/category\">category</a> property of the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement\">SpecialAnnouncement</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nMany <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement\">SpecialAnnouncement</a>s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/spatialCoverage\">spatialCoverage</a> for the region, and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/announcementLocation\">announcementLocation</a> to indicate specific <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/LocalBusiness\">LocalBusiness</a>es and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/CivicStructures\">CivicStructures</a>. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/spatialCoverage\">spatialCoverage</a> and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/announcementLocation\">announcementLocation</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nThe <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/about\">about</a> property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/about\">about</a> only\nfor representing non-location entities (e.g. a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/Course\">Course</a> or a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/RadioStation\">RadioStation</a>). For places, use <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/announcementLocation\">announcementLocation</a> and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/spatialCoverage\">spatialCoverage</a>. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of /about for locations too.<br/><br/>\n\nThe basic content of <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement\">SpecialAnnouncement</a> is similar to that of an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)\">Atom</a> feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting\n<a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement\">SpecialAnnouncement</a> updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed\nwith the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/webFeed\">webFeed</a> property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/DataFeed\">DataFeed</a> object, with <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/encodingFormat\">encodingFormat</a> providing\nmedia type information e.g. \"application/rss+xml\" or \"application/atom+xml\".",

Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).",
