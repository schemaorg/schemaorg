A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An [[Event]] that\n      is associated with a [[Schedule]] using this property should not have [[startDate]] or [[endDate]] properties.

<https://schema.org/MedicalCause> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The causative agent(s) that are responsible for the pathophysiologic process that eventually results in a medical condition, symptom or sign. In this schema, unless otherwise specified this is meant to be the proximate cause of the medical condition, symptom or sign. The proximate cause is defined as the causative agent that most directly results in the medical condition, symptom or sign. For example, the HIV virus could be considered a cause of AIDS. Or in a diagnostic context, if a patient fell and sustained a hip fracture and two days later sustained a pulmonary embolism which eventuated in a cardiac arrest, the cause of the cardiac arrest (the proximate cause) would be the pulmonary embolism and not the fall. Medical causes can include cardiovascular, chemical, dermatologic, endocrine, environmental, gastroenterologic, genetic, hematologic, gynecologic, iatrogenic, infectious, musculoskeletal, neurologic, nutritional, obstetric, oncologic, otolaryngologic, pharmacologic, psychiatric, pulmonary, renal, rheumatologic, toxic, traumatic, or urologic causes; medical conditions can be causes as well." <https://schema.org/15.0> .

Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.\n\nThe *speakable* property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:\n\n1.) *id-value* URL references - uses *id-value* of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of *speakable* has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.\n\n2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the [[cssSelector]] property.\n\n3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the [[xpath]] property.\n\n\nFor more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this\nwe define a supporting type, [[SpeakableSpecification]]  which is defined to be a possible value of the *speakable* property.\n         " <https://schema.org/15.0> .

It can be considered the [[result]] of an [[EndorseAction]] in which the [[object]] of the action is rated positively by\nsome [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the [[Action]].\n\nAn [[EndorsementRating]] may be part of a numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,\nendorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.\n" <https://schema.org/15.0> .

It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always  possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.\n      " <https://schema.org/15.0> .

In\n      the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.\n      Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\".\n\nOpen-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date.

The general trend in web technology is towards [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established [[url]] property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all [[url]] markup to use [[mobileUrl]] for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily [[Product]] and [[Offer]]) have extra URLs hosted on an additional \"mobile site\" alongside the main one.

<https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update\n      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a\n      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,\n      local government.\n\nFor work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).\n\nThe motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org\nexpect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our\nusual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).\n\n\nWhile this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover\nthe kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.\n\nSeveral kinds of information can be provided:\n\nWe encourage the provision of \"name\", \"text\", \"datePosted\", \"expires\" (if appropriate), \"category\" and\n\"url\" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for \"category\" where possible, most ideally as a well known\nURL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\_coronavirus\\_pandemic\" or \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910\".\n\nFor many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple \"[[text]]\" summary of the page. It is\nunlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.\n\nWe expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].\n\nMany [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].\n\nThe [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only\nfor representing non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places, use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for locations too.\n\nThe basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting\n[[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed\nwith the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing\nmedia type information, e.g. \"application/rss+xml\" or \"application/atom+xml\".\n" <https://schema.org/15.0> .

Ideally, a [[Claim]] description includes enough contextual information to minimize the risk of ambiguity or inclarity. In practice, many claims are better understood in the context in which they appear or the interpretations provided by claim reviews.\n\n  Beyond [[ClaimReview]], the Claim type can be associated with related creative works - for example a [[ScholarlyArticle]] or [[Question]] might be [[about]] some [[Claim]].\n\n  At this time, Schema.org does not define any types of relationship between claims.

<https://schema.org/StatisticalPopulation> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that satisfy some set of constraints. The property [[populationType]] is used to specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a [[StatisticalPopulation]] representing all [[Person]]s with a [[homeLocation]] of East Podunk California would be described by applying the appropriate [[homeLocation]] and [[populationType]] properties to a [[StatisticalPopulation]] item that stands for that set of people.\nThe properties [[numConstraints]] and [[constrainingProperty]] are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of \"population\" used here is the general sense of a statistical\npopulation, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a [[populationType]] of [[Event]] or [[NewsArticle]] could be used. See also [[Observation]], and the [data and datasets](/docs/data-and-datasets.html) overview for more details.\n  " <https://schema.org/15.0> .

For example, opinion pieces, reviews, analysis, sponsored or satirical articles, or articles that combine several of these elements.\n\nThe [[ReportageNewsArticle]] type is based on a stricter ideal for \"news\" as a work of journalism, with articles based on factual information either observed or verified by the author, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.  This often includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing news reports from public relations or propaganda).  News reports in the [[ReportageNewsArticle]] sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value judgements typically expressed elsewhere.\n\nA [[ReportageNewsArticle]] which goes deeper into analysis can also be marked with an additional type of [[AnalysisNewsArticle]].\n" <https://schema.org/15.0> .

<https://schema.org/EventSeries> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A series of [[Event]]s. Included events can relate with the series using the [[superEvent]] property.\n\nAn EventSeries is a collection of events that share some unifying characteristic. For example, \"The Olympic Games\" is a series, which\nis repeated regularly. The \"2012 London Olympics\" can be presented both as an [[Event]] in the series \"Olympic Games\", and as an\n[[EventSeries]] that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.\n\nThe nature of the association between the events in an [[EventSeries]] can vary, but typical examples could\ninclude a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.\n\nEventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without\nworrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries\nmay seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but\nit may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.\n   " <https://schema.org/15.0> .

GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.\n\nThe GS1 [digital link specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/) express GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also [schema.org tracking issue](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3156#issuecomment-1209522809) for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a \"GS1 Digital Link\" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1's GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]], and [[gtin14]] properties.\n\nNote also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details." <https://schema.org/15.0> .

CreativeWorkSeries are usually organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike [[ItemList]] which is a general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as TV, radio and games).\\n\\nSpecific subtypes are available for describing [[TVSeries]], [[RadioSeries]], [[MovieSeries]], [[BookSeries]], [[Periodical]] and [[VideoGameSeries]]. In each case, the [[hasPart]] / [[isPartOf]] properties can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.\\n\\nIt is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.\n	  " <https://schema.org/15.0> .

<https://schema.org/SuperficialAnatomy> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure)." <https://schema.org/15.0> .
