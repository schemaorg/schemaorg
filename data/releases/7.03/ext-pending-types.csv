"http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement","SpecialAnnouncement","A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,      local government.<br/><br/><br/><br/>For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#"">this doc</a>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic"">Coronavirus pandemic</a>, and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.orgexpect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to ourusual <a href=""https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490"">Github entry</a>, feedback comments can also be provided in <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#"">this document</a>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol"">CAP</a>, although there may be overlaps. The intent is to coverthe kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Several kinds of information can be provided:<br/><br/><br/><br/>We encourage the provision of ""name"", ""text"", ""datePosted"", ""expires"" (if appropriate), ""category"" and""url"" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for ""category"" where possible, most ideally as a well knownURL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be ""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20<em>coronavirus</em>pandemic"" or ""https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910"".<br/><br/><br/><br/>For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/WebContent"">WebContent</a> type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple ""<a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/text"">text</a>"" summary of the page. It isunlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/openingHours"">openingHours</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/Event"">Event</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/FAQPage"">FAQPage</a> etc. By linking to those pages from a <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a> you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/category"">category</a> property of the <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Many <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a>s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/spatialCoverage"">spatialCoverage</a> for the region, and <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/announcementLocation"">announcementLocation</a> to indicate specific <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/LocalBusiness"">LocalBusiness</a>es and <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/CivicStructures"">CivicStructures</a>. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/spatialCoverage"">spatialCoverage</a> and <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/announcementLocation"">announcementLocation</a>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/about"">about</a> property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/about"">about</a> onlyfor representing non-location entities (e.g. a <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/Course"">Course</a> or a <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/RadioStation"">RadioStation</a>). For places, use <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/announcementLocation"">announcementLocation</a> and <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/spatialCoverage"">spatialCoverage</a>. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of /about for locations too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The basic content of <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a> is similar to that of an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS"">RSS</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)"">Atom</a> feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting<a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a> updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feedwith the <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/webFeed"">webFeed</a> property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/DataFeed"">DataFeed</a> object, with <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/encodingFormat"">encodingFormat</a> providingmedia type information e.g. ""application/rss+xml"" or ""application/atom+xml"".","http://schema.org/CreativeWork","","","http://schema.org/abstract, http://schema.org/acquireLicensePage, http://schema.org/announcementLocation, http://schema.org/conditionsOfAccess, http://schema.org/contentReferenceTime, http://schema.org/correction, http://schema.org/creativeWorkStatus, http://schema.org/diseasePreventionInfo, http://schema.org/diseaseSpreadStatistics, http://schema.org/gettingTestedInfo, http://schema.org/maintainer, http://schema.org/materialExtent, http://schema.org/newsUpdatesAndGuidelines, http://schema.org/publicTransportClosuresInfo, http://schema.org/quarantineGuidelines, http://schema.org/schoolClosuresInfo, http://schema.org/sdDatePublished, http://schema.org/sdLicense, http://schema.org/sdPublisher, http://schema.org/travelBans, http://schema.org/usageInfo, http://schema.org/webFeed","","","","http://pending.schema.org"
