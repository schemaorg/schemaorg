An EventSeries is a collection of events that share some unifying characteristic. For example, ""The Olympic Games"" is a series, which
is repeated regularly. The ""2012 London Olympics"" can be presented both as an <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/Event"">Event</a> in the series ""Olympic Games"", and as an
<a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/EventSeries"">EventSeries</a> that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

The nature of the association between the events in an <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/EventSeries"">EventSeries</a> can vary, but typical examples could
include a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without
worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries
may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but
it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.","http://schema.org/Event, http://schema.org/Series","","","","","","","http://pending.schema.org"

"http://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle","ReportageNewsArticle","The <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle"">ReportageNewsArticle</a> type is a subtype of <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/NewsArticle"">NewsArticle</a> representing
 news articles which are the result of journalistic news reporting conventions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

In practice many news publishers produce a wide variety of article types, many of which might be considered a <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/NewsArticle"">NewsArticle</a> but not a <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle"">ReportageNewsArticle</a>. For example, opinion pieces, reviews, analysis, sponsored or satirical articles, or articles that combine several of these elements.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

The <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle"">ReportageNewsArticle</a> type is based on a stricter ideal for ""news"" as a work of journalism, with articles based on factual information either observed or verified by the author, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.  This often includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing news reports from public relations or propaganda).  News reports in the <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle"">ReportageNewsArticle</a> sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value judgements typically expressed elsewhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

A <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle"">ReportageNewsArticle</a> which goes deeper into analysis can also be marked with an additional type of <a class=""localLink"" href=""http://schema.org/AnalysisNewsArticle"">AnalysisNewsArticle</a>.","http://schema.org/NewsArticle","","","","","","","http://pending.schema.org"
