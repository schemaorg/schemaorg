Consumers of schema.org data who encourage use of such terms are strongly encouraged to update implementations and documentation to track any evolving changes, and to share early implementation feedback with the wider community."

Organizations using this data are encouraged to join the community discussions linked here, and share their usage scenarios to help improve the schemas.\n\nThe schema.org [medical vocabulary](/docs/meddocs.html) was [originally created](http://blog.schema.org/2012/06/health-and-medical-vocabulary-for.html) in collaboration with [WikiDoc](http://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Main_Page) and others. Recent improvements including the migration into the health-lifesci extension has been led by the Healthcare Schema ([schemed](https://www.w3.org/community/schemed/)) community group at W3C.  The health-lifesci schema.org extension is [available](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1116) for other collaborative schema.org extensions in topics centred on healthcare, medicine and the lifesciences (e.g. see also [Bioschemas](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1028), and the [pending](http://pending.schema.org/) proposals for describing [US healthcare insurance networks](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1062))."
