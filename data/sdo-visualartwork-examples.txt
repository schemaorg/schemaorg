PRE-MARKUP:

Fairly straightforward painting markup.

    <div>
        <h1 lang="fr">La trahison des images </h1>
        <p>
            A painting also known as The Treason of Images or 
            The Treachery of Images.
        </p>

        <div>
            <p>
                The painting shows a pipe. Below it, Magritte painted, 
                <q lang="fr">Ceci n'est pas une pipe.</q>, French for 
                "This is not a pipe."
            </p>
            <p>
                His statement is taken to mean that the painting itself is not a pipe. 
                The painting is merely an image of a pipe. Hence, the description, 
                "this is not a pipe."
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the image shown above is neither a pipe nor even a painting, 
                but rather a digital photograph.
            </p>
            <p>
                The painting is sometimes given as an example of meta message conveyed 
                by paralanguage. Compare with Korzybski's <q>The word is not the thing</q> 
                and <q>The map is not the territory</q>.

            My Bed, first created in <time datetime="1998">1998</time>,

                <time datetime="1998">1999</time> as one 
                of the shortlisted works for the Turner Prize. It consisted of her 
                bed with bedroom objects in an abject state, and gained much media 
                attention. Although it did not win the prize, its notoriety has

        <p>
            The artwork generated considerable media furore, particularly over the 
            fact that the bedsheets were stained with bodily secretions and the floor 
            had items from the artist's room (such as condoms, a pair of knickers with 
            menstrual period stains, other detritus, and functional, everyday objects, 
            including a pair of slippers). The bed was presented in the state that 
            Emin claimed it had been when she said she had not got up from it for 
            several days due to suicidal depression brought on by relationship 
            difficulties.

                <cite>Still Life under the Lamp</cite>, from 1962, made when the artist 
                was eighty years old, are counted among Picasso’s most important works 
                in linocut, a technique that he explored in the late 1950s and early 
                1960s. The progressive proofs show the step by step sequence by which 
                Picasso created his linocut images showing the development of the 
                image into its final form.
