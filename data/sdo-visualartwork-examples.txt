PRE-MARKUP:

Fairly straightforward painting markup.

    <div>
        <h1 lang="fr">La trahison des images </h1>
        <p>
            A painting also known as The Treason of Images or
            The Treachery of Images.

            <p>
                The painting shows a pipe. Below it, Magritte painted,
                <q lang="fr">Ceci n'est pas une pipe.</q>, French for
                "This is not a pipe."
            </p>
            <p>
                His statement is taken to mean that the painting itself is not a pipe.
                The painting is merely an image of a pipe. Hence, the description,
                "this is not a pipe."
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the image shown above is neither a pipe nor even a painting,
                but rather a digital photograph.
            </p>
            <p>
                The painting is sometimes given as an example of meta message conveyed
                by paralanguage. Compare with Korzybski's <q>The word is not the thing</q>
                and <q>The map is not the territory</q>.

                of the shortlisted works for the Turner Prize. It consisted of her
                bed with bedroom objects in an abject state, and gained much media

            Emin claimed it had been when she said she had not got up from it for
            several days due to suicidal depression brought on by relationship
            difficulties.

                <cite>Still Life under the Lamp</cite>, from 1962, made when the artist
                was eighty years old, are counted among Picasso’s most important works
                in linocut, a technique that he explored in the late 1950s and early
                1960s. The progressive proofs show the step by step sequence by which
                Picasso created his linocut images showing the development of the
                image into its final form.
