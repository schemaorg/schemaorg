        <p>In this course you will get an introduction to the main tools and ideas in the

        components to this course. The first is a conceptual introduction to the ideas
        behind turning data into actionable knowledge. The second is a practical
        introduction to the tools that will be used in the program like version control,
        markdown, git, GitHub, R, and RStudio.</p>
