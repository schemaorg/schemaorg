## `StatVarObservation`
##
## 2022-02-22
## 
## Revision of earlier model - refactoring to pull statistical info out of Observation into StatisticalVariable
## - consider change observedNode to something not using 'node' terminology; eg. aboutFoo
## - move measuredProperty from Observation to StatisticalVariable
## - also stattype
## - add to Observation /variableMeasured that can take /StarVar or a /Property
## - vocabulary for statistical types
## Each `StatisticalVariable` node is an abstract specification about which we can
## make observations that are grounded at a particular location and time. These is
## represented by the [`StatVarObservation`](https://datacommons.org/browser/StatVarObservation) type.

#-   `observationAbout`: the DC entity the observation is about
#-   `value`: numeric/string value of the observation
#-   `observationDate`: the date of (or last day of) the observation
#-   `observationPeriod` (optional): the length of time the observation took place
#-   `unit` (optional): an instance of [UnitOfMeasure](https://datacommons.org/browser/UnitOfMeasure)
#-   `measurementMethod` (optional): an Enumeration instance that describes the methodology
#    used in the measurement (here, the [ACS 5-year
