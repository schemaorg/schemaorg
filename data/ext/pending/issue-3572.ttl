    rdfs:comment """Describes the amount that can be redeemed from this incentive.
    
<p>[[QuantitativeValue]]: Use this for incentives based on price (either raw amount or percentage-based). For a raw amount example, "You can claim $2,500 - $7,500 from the total cost of installation" would be represented as the following:</p>
    {
        "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
        “minValue”: 2500,
        “maxValue”: 7500,
        "unitCode": "USD"
    }
<p>[[QuantitativeValue]] can also be used for percentage amounts. In such cases, value is used to represent the incentive’s percentage, while maxValue represents a limit (if one exists) to that incentive. The unitCode should be 'P1' and the unitText should be '%', while valueReference should be used for holding the currency type. For example, "You can claim up to 30% of the total cost of installation, up to a maximum of $7,500" would be:</p>
    {
        "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
        "value": 30,
        "unitCode": "P1",
        "unitText": "%",
        “maxValue”: 7500,
        “valueReference”: “USD”
    }
<p>[[UnitPriceSpecification]]: Use this for incentives that are based on amounts rather than price. For example, a net metering rebate that pays $10/kWh, up to $1,000:</p>
    {
        "@type": "UnitPriceSpecification",
        "price": 10,
        "priceCurrency": "USD",
        "referenceQuantity": 1,
        "unitCode": "DO3",
        "unitText": "kw/h",
        "maxPrice": 1000,
        "description": "$10 / kwh up to $1000"
    }
<p>[[LoanOrCredit]]: Use for incentives that are loan based. For example, a loan of $4,000 - $50,000 with a repayment term of 10 years, interest free would look like:</p>
    {
        "@type": "LoanOrCredit",
        "loanTerm": {
                "@type":"QuantitativeValue",
                "value":"10",
                "unitCode": "ANN"
            },
        "amount":[
            {
                "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
                "Name":"fixed interest rate",
                "value":"0",
            },
        ],
        "amount":[
            {
                "@type": "MonetaryAmount",
                "Name":"min loan amount",
                "value":"4000",
                "currency":"CAD"
            },
            {
                "@type": "MonetaryAmount",
                "Name":"max loan amount",
                "value":"50000",
                "currency":"CAD"
            }
        ],
    }

In summary: <ul><li>Use [[QuantitativeValue]] for absolute/percentage-based incentives applied on the price of a good/service.</li>
<li>Use [[UnitPriceSpecification]] for incentives based on a per-unit basis (e.g. net metering).</li>
<li>Use [[LoanOrCredit]] for loans/credits.</li>
