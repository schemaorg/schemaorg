It is sometimes the case that detailed distinctions between Web pages, sites and their parts is not always important or obvious. The  [[WebContent]] type makes it easier to describe Web-addressable content without requiring such distinctions to always be stated. (The intent is that the existing types [[WebPage]], [[WebSite]] and [[WebPageElement]] will eventually be declared as subtypes of [[WebContent]].)
