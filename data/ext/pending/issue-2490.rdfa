<!--
The approach has a simple core but could be extended easily for additional use cases (e.g. adding statistics, contact info). It complements and contextualizes the rest of Schema.org, i.e. it tells us that a page with Events or FAQ markup
isn't about any random event or FAQ topic, but about a particular urgent situation e.g. a Coronavirus outbreak.

    <div typeof="rdfs:Class" resource="http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">
      <span>Category: <span property="schema:category">issue-2490</span></span>
      <span class="h" property="rdfs:label">SpecialAnnouncement</span>
      <span property="rdfs:comment">A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update
      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a
      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,
      local government.

The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org
expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our
usual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).

While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover
the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.

Several kinds of information can be provided:

We encourage the provision of "name", "text", "datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate) and
"url" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category" where possible, most ideally as a well known
URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\_coronavirus\_pandemic" or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910".

For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple "[[text]]" summary of the page. It is
unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously. More options may be added
later if

We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation
(e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].


The basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting
[[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed
with the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing
media type information e.g. "application/rss+xml" or "application/atom+xml".

For an announcement that is about a place, you can use [[about]] (or [[mainEntity]]) to make that relationship explicit.
For example, the announcement could be "about" a new [[CovidTestingFacility]], and provide contact information, [[location]], [[geo]],
[[openingHours]] etc.

      disease is available. If the facility is being made available from an established [[Pharmacy]], [[Hotel]], or other
      non-medical organization, multiple types can be listed. This makes it easier to re-use existing schema.org information
      about that place e.g. contact info, address, opening hours. Note that in an emergency, such information may not always be reliable.
