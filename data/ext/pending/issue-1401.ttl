[[LearningResource]] is expected to be used as an addition to a primary type such as [[Book]], [[Video]], [[Product]] etc.

[[EducationEvent]] serves a similar purpose for event-like things (e.g. a [[Trip]]). A [[LearningResource]] may be created as a result of an [[EducationEvent]], for example by recording one.""" ;
