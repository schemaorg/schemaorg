0-a) Technical pre-conditions for release.

Overview

Code, schema, examples and supporting documentation should be in a stable state.

Pay particular attention to release-specific structures and docs/releases.html

In sdoapp.py we declare the current version. This should match the number
chosen in /docs/releases.html (check markup assigns an HTML ID too).

The following steps assume a general healthy freeze (tested / QA as below).

in sdoapp.py:

    SCHEMA_VERSION=2.2 # or 2.x, as above.

in sdoapp.py:

  releaselog = { "2.0": "2015-05-13", "2.1": "2015-08-06" }

becomes

  releaselog = { "2.0": "2015-05-13", "2.1": "2015-08-06", "2.2": "2015-11-05" }


... this should have a release date for the current release and all
previous releases that are archived under data/releases/{version}/*

TODO: Add a unit test to ensure this.

TODO: Re-order this document to avoid forward references.

Under data/releases/{version}/ we need a versioned-snapshot structure:

e.g.
    data/releases/2.1
    data/releases/2.1/all-layers.nq
    data/releases/2.1/core.nq
    data/releases/2.1/ext-auto.nq
    data/releases/2.1/ext-bib.nq
    data/releases/2.1/README.md
    data/releases/2.1/schema-all.html
    data/releases/2.1/schema.nt
    data/releases/2.1/schema.rdfa

Of these,

 * schema.rdfa is a frozen one-time copy of data/schema.rdfa
 * schema-all.html is generated from this via running the Web app and
   capturing via curl, e.g. http://localhost:8080/version/2.1/
   served locally via "dev_appserver ."
   (TODO: confirm whether grabbing via localhost is safe or needs manual fixups)
 * the .nt and .nq files are n-triples and n-quads capturing the core
   and extensions. Use script/rdfa2nq for the latter.
   TODO: add scripts/rdfa for ntriples convertor.
  * We consider schema.rdfa as immutable; the rest can be fixed and augmented
   as they are derrived and potentially improvable formats.
  * we don't preserve snapshots of per-extension RDFa here (or examples etc.)
  * README.md should be copied/updated accordingly.  TODO: simplify this file.

Example usage:

Use of rdfa2nq with extensions:

./scripts/rdfa2nq data/ext/bib/bsdo-1.0.rdfa http://bib.schema.org/#v2.1 > data/releases/2.1/ext-bib.nq
./scripts/rdfa2nq data/ext/bib/comics.rdfa http://bib.schema.org/#v2.1 >> data/releases/2.1/ext-bib.nq
./scripts/rdfa2nq data/ext/auto/auto.rdfa http://auto.schema.org/#v2.1 > data/releases/2.1/ext-auto.nq

TODO: explain where all-layers.nq comes from (cat'ing the others)
TODO: list optional tasks post-launch (blog, email, refresh dydra sparql db etc.).



1) General preconditions / process and QA for release.

1-a) Steering Group have signed off on changes and release plan,
and no active and unresolved disputes in the Community Group.

1-b) All code is commited to appropriate release branch at Github (usually
configured as the current default github branch for /schemaorg/ project).

1-c) All tests pass.
It is best to test against a fresh checkout to avoid depending on uncommitted
files. The unit tests depend upon a local installation of Google AppEngine, e.g.

PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/google_appengine ./scripts/run_tests.py

To run the full unit tests (graph test of schema integrity) the 'rdflib'
python library is also needed: 'sudo easy_install rdflib' should do it.

  [...]

  Ran 70 tests in 21.168s

  OK (expected failures=3)

1-d) Latest candidate release branch is pushed to per-branch appspot instance
(e.g. sdo-phobos.appspot.com) and the generic unstable upstream site
(i.e. webschemas.org).

1-e) The manual QA page /docs/qa.html has been reviewed to ensure
representative pages of each type appear to be in a healthy state.

e.g. see http://webschemas.org/docs/qa.html
