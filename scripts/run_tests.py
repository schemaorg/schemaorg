# This script runs the Schema.org unit tests. The basic tests are concerned
# with our site infrastructure; loading and accessing data.  The graph tests
# are concerned with the shape/size of the schema graph itself.

# Currently this means they require Google AppEngine to be installed,
# because api.py and sdoapp.py both  depend upon AppEngine. This is
# something we should minimise - eventually only
# sdoapp.py should need AppEngine.  We use W3C SPARQL for the graph tests,
# and therefore these tests will only run  if 'rdflib' is installed.
#
# We do not currently test the generated Web site with unit tests. However
# please see /docs/qa.html for some useful links to check whenever site UI
# code is being changed.
#
# There are two dependencies:
#
# 1. AppEngine SDK
# Typically in ~/google_cloud_sdk and/or linked from /usr/local/google_appengine
# This script will do its best to update your python path to point to
# the SDK (whether you point to it directly or the broader Cloud SDK), to
# AppEngine's tools and libs and to other bundled libraries. But to bootstrap
# this is needs to at least find dev_appserver.
#
# 2. rdflib
#
# A normal Python package. Take care that it is installed against the version of
# Python that is being used to run this script. easy_install or pip should work.
# We may later bundle this, see https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/178
