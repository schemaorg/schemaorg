Recent improvements including the migration into the health-lifesci extension has been led by the Healthcare Schema ([schemed](https://www.w3.org/community/schemed/)) community group at W3C.  The health-lifesci schema.org extension is [available](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1116) for other collaborative schema.org extensions in topics centred on healthcare, medicine and the lifesciences (e.g. see also [Bioschemas](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1028), and the [pending](http://pending.schema.org/) proposals for describing [US healthcare insurance networks](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1062))."
