<h3>Schema.org Section: meta</h3>
<p>Schema.org is a set of extensible schemas that enables webmasters to embed structured data on their web pages for use by search engines and other applications.
For more details, see the <a href="/">homepage</a>.

</p>

<p>
The meta section contains terms primarily designed to support the implementation of the Schema.org vocabulary itself. 
It includes terms such as {{ sdotermlink('Class')|safe }}, {{ sdotermlink('Property')|safe }}, {{ sdotermlink('domainIncludes')|safe }} and {{ sdotermlink('supersededBy')|safe }}. 
They are not currently advocated for widespread use across the web.
