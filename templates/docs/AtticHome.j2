<h3>Schema.org Section: attic</h3>
<p>Schema.org is a set of extensible schemas that enables webmasters to embed structured data on their web pages for use by search engines and other applications.
For more details, see the <a href="/">homepage</a>.

<p>
  The attic area is an archive area for terms which are no longer part of the core vocabulary or its extensions. <em>Attic</em> terms are preserved here to satisfy previous links to them.<br/>

Implementors and publishers are gently encouraged not to use terms in the attic area.
