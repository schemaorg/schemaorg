<h1>About Schema.org</h1>
    <p>
Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create,
maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet. In addition
to people from the founding companies (Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex), there is  substantial participation by the
larger Web community, through public mailing lists such as <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/">public-vocabs@w3.org</a>
and through <a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg">GitHub</a>. See the <a href="/docs/releases.html">releases</a> page for more details, and the
<a href="/docs/faq.html">FAQ</a> for supporting information.
 </p>

<p>Since April 2015, the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg">Schema.org Community Group</a> is the main forum for schema collaboration, and provides the
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg/">public-schemaorg@w3.org</a> mailing list for discussions. Schema.org issues are tracked
<a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues">on GitHub</a>.</p>

 <p>
    The day to day operations of Schema.org, including decisions regarding the schema, are handled by a steering group,
    which includes representatives of the founding companies, a representative of the W3C and a small
    number of  individuals who have contributed substantially to Schema.org. Discussions of the steering group
    are public.
 </p>

<h2 id="cgsg">Community Group and Steering Group</h2>

<br/>

<p>
Schema.org is organized via two groups: a small Steering Group responsible for high level oversight of the project (including approval of new releases),
and a larger Community Group which handles the day to day activity of schema evolution, discussion and integration.
Schema.org's Community Group prepares releases for the approval of the Steering Group. A <a href="howwework.html#webmaster">schema.org project webmaster</a>
(currently Dan Brickley) assists the steering group with the implementation of this process. See <a href="howwework.html">how we work</a> for more details on this workflow.
</p>

<p>
The Schema.org Steering Group is chaired by R.V. Guha, who serves in an <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg/2016Feb/0000.html">individual capacity</a>.
The regular Steering Group participants from the search engines are Peter Mika from Yahoo; Alex Shubin, Yuliya Tikhokhod and Charles Nevile from Yandex;
Shankar Natarajan, Tom Marsh and Steve Macbeth from Microsoft; and Vicki Tardif Holand and Dan Brickley from Google.
In April 2015 the Steering Group unanimously agreed to expand its membership to include Stéphane Corlosquet and Martin Hepp,
and to offer a seat to a representative from W3C. The Steering Group has a
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/schema-org-sg">mailing list</a>
- mostly used for scheduling periodic phone/skype/etc calls, whose notes are posted to public GitHub and linked from
<a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1" class="issue-link" title="Meta: schema.org planning">issue #1</a> in the project's issue tracker.

</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">Schema.org Community Group</a> is chaired by Dan Brickley, who acts in this
capacity on behalf of the schema.org project rather than his employer, Google. It is open to any interested parties who have agreed to the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community Contributor License Agreement</a>.
The role of the Community Group is to propose, discuss, prepare and review changes to schema.org, for final review and publication by the Steering Group.
The Community Group also serves as a hub for discussion with other related communities, at W3C and elsewhere.
The <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg">schema.org GitHub repository</a> is considered a tool of the Community Group, and is currently
the main focus for community discussion.
</p>


<p>In other words, the W3C schema.org Community Group is the main forum for the project -
<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/</a>.
It is Github-based in the sense that its GitHub repository - <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/">https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/</a> ...
<ul>
<li>is where all the materials are - examples, schemas, documentation, software</li>
<li>is where the project community develop more complex proposals as branches</li>
<li>holds the issue tracker where changes are discussed</li>
<li>issues <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1" class="issue-link" title="Meta: schema.org planning">#1</a> (planning), <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2" class="issue-link" title="Proposed vocabulary additions/changes - general rolling overview">#2</a> (vocab changes) and <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3" class="issue-link" title="Meta bug to provide overview of all python/site tool issues">#3</a> (tooling/infrastructure) provide some views into to the various fine-grained issues, as do the labels we attach e.g. <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22type%3Acleanup+%2B+clarity%22">cleanup</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note also that other W3C Community Groups exist that are focussed partially or entirely on schema.org improvements, e.g. <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemed/">health and medicine</a>,  <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/sport-schema/">sports</a>,  <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/architypes/">archives</a>,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemabibex/">libraries and bibliography</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/gao/">autos</a>... ...these groups have their own ways of working, and coordinate via the main Schema.org Community Group and its Github repository.
