<h1>How We Work</h1>

<p>
This document provides a brief overview of schema.org's process for developing and
changing schemas. It accompanies the <a href="about.html">about schema.org</a> page
which describes the organizational structure of the project.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>: the <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a> site contains the officially released
  version of schema.org, while <a href="http://webschemas.org/">webschemas.org</a> is a
  work-in-progress development version of schema.org containing more recent fixes and improvements but which may also
  contain changes that do not represent the consensus of the wider community or of the project <a href="/about.html">steering group</a>. See <a href="#pending">'pending'</a>
  below for more details.
</p>

<p>This document contains a minimal amount of technical detail sufficient to explain
  our approach to schema evolution. Operational details for project collaborators can be found via
  the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/how-we-work/">how we work</a>
  section of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">Schema.org W3C Community Group</a>.
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p id="#ataglance">A quick summary.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most materials on schema.org are updated via <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html">official named releases</a> (every few weeks).</li>
  <li>Simple improvements around supporting documentation, examples, sofware bugs etc. can be fast-tracked by the project <a href="about.html">steering group</a> as "Early Access Fixes"; these are
    also recorded in the <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html">release</a> page.</li>
  <li>Improvements are discussed in our <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg">community group</a> at W3C, typically in the project's <a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues">github issue tracker</a>.</li>
  <li>A work-in-progress development version of the site named "<a href="http://webschemas.org/">webschemas.org</a>" is maintained by the schema.org community group chair based on github/w3c discussions, proposals and change requests. It forms the basis for periodic "release candidates" and reflects the current state of the project's public Github repository.</li>
  <li>A 'live' hosted extension dedicated to "pending" new vocabulary proposals is maintained as part of this process at <a href="http://pending.webschemas.org/">pending.webschemas.org</a>.
    This serves to highlight possible new vocabulary improvements but may not always reflect wider consensus in the community and steering groups. [for discussion: should this be sync'd immediately to schema.org for wider visibility?].</li>
  <li>Periodically, snapshots of the community's <em>rough consensus</em> are published as release candidates by the community group chair, for review by the <a href="about.html">steering group</a>.</li>
  <li>After steering group review and approval, the schema.org site is updated with the new material.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Versioning and change control</h3>
<p>
Schema.org is developed incrementally. Since 2011 we have published several
substantial updates a year. These are known as <em>releases</em> and are
documented on the <a href="/docs/releases.html">releases</a> page. Each release
has a name that is assigned upon publication (e.g. "2.1"). Recent releases have
also been given project-internal code names prior to launch, e.g. "sdo-phobos",
which makes it easier to decide upon the final name (e.g. "2.9" versus "3.0") as the work
develops.
</p>

<p>
The content of each release is based on public discussions hosted on W3C's
community group platform and on the Github site. Historically, all changes to the
project have been through unanimous agreement of the Steering Group membership,
strongly informed by the opinions, contributions and discussions in the wider
community.
</p>

<p>
Recently we have been expanding on this model with two types of <a href="extension.html">extension</a> vocabulary: hosted and external extensions.
Hosted extensions are effectively part of schema.org but "tagged" within a subdomain (e.g. <a href="http://bib.schema.org/">bib.schema.org</a>,
<a href="http://auto.schema.org/">auto.schema.org</a>). External extensions (e.g.
see <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2016/02/gs1-milestone-first-schemaorg-external.html">GS1's Web Vocabulary</a>) are published elsewhere in the Web, and are typically managed by other
organizations with their own processes, versioning systems and collaboration mechanisms. Hosted extensions are managed and published as part
of the schema.org project, with their design often led by one of more dedicated community groups. As more communities begin contributing
via hosted extensions we expect to revise this document to provide more details on publication and versioning workflow for these extensions. At the current time
hosted extensions are updated in the same release schedule as the schema.org core vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
For general use, publishers and consumers are encouraged to use the latest release and to use simple non-versioned schema.org URLs such as 'http://schema.org/Place'
in structured data applications. However there are settings in which more precise versioning is important. Schema.org also provides dated snapshots of each release, including
both human and machine readable definitions of the schema.org core vocabulary. These are linked from the <a href="releases.html">releases page</a>. In addition,
the <a href="/schemaVersion">schemaVersion</a> property has been defined to provide a way for documents to indicate the specific intended version of schema.org's
definitions. Finally, all changes to the site and its underlying software are now <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/">published via Github</a>.
</p>

<h3>Schema structure</h3>

<p>The schema.org site contains:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A homepage and a few <a href="/docs/documents.html">overview documents</a> such as this.</li>
 <li>Term definitions - one page for each term. Every schema.org term is either a type (e.g. <a href="/Event">Event</a>),
   a property (e.g. <a href="/workPerformed">workPerformed</a>),
   or an enumerated value (e.g. <a href="/ReservationCancelled">ReservationCancelled</a>). Definitions consist of an identifier such as "Event",
   a short textual (HTML) definition, including cross-references and links, as well some factual metadata about the terms. The approach we
   use is based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">W3C RDFS</a> with some customizations summarized below.
 </li>
 <li>Machine-readable files (not intended for humans):
   <ul>
     <li><a href="/docs/schema_org_rdfa.html">schema_org_rdfa.html</a> - the underlying technical definition of the schemas.</li>
     <li>A <a href="/docs/jsonldcontext.json">JSON-LD context file</a> (also available to software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation">via</a> the homepage, in application/ld+json format).
       This is generated by software automatically, and is needed for schema.org's use with the W3C JSON-LD format. The main purpose is to record
       for each property in schema.org whether the default interpretation of a string value in JSON-LD should be URL or text. This allows publishers to
       use relative links (e.g. "../news/") more reliably. Schema.org properties that expect <a href="/URL">URL</a> amongst their values are listed in this
       way in the JSON-LD definitions. Currently the history of the context document is not archived, but <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1101">discussion</a> on this point is welcome.
     </li>
     <li>Other machine-oriented files are available via <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/tree/sdo-deimos/data">github</a>.</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Schema definitions</h3>

 <p>Schema.org essentially defines a dictionary of terms (types, properties and enumerated values). To understand its evolution, a brief summary
   of the definition structure is needed (see also <a href="datamodel.html">datamodel overview</a>). In schema.org, each type can have one or more supertypes,
 although it is rare to have more than one supertype. This provides the main <a href="/docs/full.html">hierarchical</a> navigational structure of schema.org: a tree of
 types with <a href="/Thing">Thing</a> at the root. Each property may have a more general super-property (e.g. <a href="/partOfSeason">partOfSeason</a> is a specialization of
 <a href="/isPartOf">isPartOf</a>), but there is no unified hierarchy of properties. Pairs of properties can also be marked as being inverses of each other: i.e. they
 say effectively the thing, expressed in opposite direction, e.g. <a href="/alumni">alumni</a>/<a href="/alumniOf">alumniOf</a>, <a href="/isPartOf">isPartOf</a>/<a href="/hasPart">hasPart</a>.
 </p>

 <p>It is also important to understand what schema.org does <em>not</em> define or dictate. In particular schema.org does not define any notion of 'mandatory' property.
This is a matter on which the information available on sites can naturally vary, and the information needs of consuming services may also vary. We do not attempt
to reach consensus at schema.org on what an ideal description of some type (Person, Place, TVSeries etc.) ought to contain - this makes consensus easier to achieve.
The site does contain many practical markup examples, which give rough hints about common and useful patterns for combining schema.org terms.</p>

<p>
Each release includes several kinds of change:
<ul>
<li>Bug fixes and minor improvements (e.g. typos, markup errors in examples)</li>
<li>New examples.</li>
<li>Adjustments to the textual descriptions of terms (i.e. types, properties and
  enumerated values).</li>
<li>Adjustments to the examples that accompany each term, and to the indexing of which terms an example should show up against. Although examples are
  not formally part of the schema definitions, they play a central role in schema.org's widescale adoption and are versioned as part of the release.</li>
<li>Adjustments to the machine-readable claims we make about each term: supertype(s), superproperties, inverses, and the associations that link types and properties together.
  For each property we maintain a list of one or more types that it is expected to be applied to (technically, "domainIncludes"), alongside one or more types
  that are expected as its values. We may also mark some properties as "supersededBy" others. It is exceptionally rare for a property, type or enumerated value to be
  deleted/removed without leaving it in the system as 'supersededBy' another. Additional machine-readable metadata in RDFS/OWL is also used to  express mappings
  internally and to external vocabularies. These mappings also evolve.
</li>
<li>Term descriptions and definitions can be moved between schema.org's core and its hosted extensions. Each schema.org term is marked as being 'partOf' either the core
  or exactly one extension, and terms can move in either direction. Terms can be generalized for wider use and moved into the core, or migrated from the core into a hosted extension. In both cases, textual
  definitions and machine-readable definitions may be adjusted.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Schema.org property names are considered "global" across the entire project (including the core and all hosted vocabularies such as 'auto', 'bib' etc.).
For example, there is only one property such as "startDate", and both its human-readable and machine-readable definitions need to be appropriate to all the
situations in which it might be used. In the case of "startDate" (defined currently as "The start date and time of the item"), the text has to be appropriate to
all of the different combinations of types it can be used with. </p>

<p>
This situation drives many of the evolutionary changes to schema.org. Often properties are added for some specific use case, and their potential relationship to other areas of schema.org only becomes clear later. This gives rise to changes in textual definition
and property-to-type associations that gradually make schema.org more coherent, without introducing radical changes in meaning. Consumers of schema.org data can generally
rely on schema.org term meanings not changing dramatically; however term definitions often evolve gradually. A common change is for a property to be applicable
to some previously unrelated type, or to expect to take values of a new type. When this happens the textual definitions are often adjusted slightly too. This is either by
listing the new types explicitly, or through the use of a more general term like "item", "entity" or "thing".
</p>


<h3 id="extensibility">Extensibility Mechanisms</h3>
<p>
In addition to the two dedicated <a href="extension.html">extension</a> mechanisms (hosted and external) there are several other ways in which schema.org structured
data can be extended with complete independence from the evolving definitions and discussions at schema.org.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Schema.org data can be published within the same page or document as other kinds of structured data e.g. microformats, RDFa, JSON-LD and Microdata that
    use independent vocabularies.</li>
  <li>Schema.org provides the <a href="http://schema.org/PropertyValue">PropertyValue</a> which can be used to expose arbitrary property/value data pairs
    within a larger schema.org description. This is used e.g. on e-commerce sites to expose key/value information that does not map easily into schema.org terminology.</li>
  <li>Schema.org provides the <a href="/Role">Role</a> mechanism which allows any piece of schema.org to be arbitrarily annotated with extra information.</li>
  <li>Schema.org's supported syntaxes (in particular JSON-LD andRDFa but to some extent Microdata) support the mixing of other independent schemas into a schema.org-based
    description. Schema.org in JSON-LD (via our <a href="/docs/jsonldcontext.json">context definition</a>) and in RDFa 1.1 (via W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/rdfa-context/rdfa-1.1">initial context</a> definition
    has pre-supported declarations for many additional schemas identified by short prefix, e.g. 'dc' for Dublin Core.</li>
</ul>

<p>These mechanisms provide for greater expressivity within schema.org-based structured data. Their use is independent of schema.org vocabulary definitions and
  release planning, versioning etc. and no community approval, agreement or consensus is needed to make use of these mechanisms.
</p>


<h3 id="pending">Early Access Fixes and Pending Releases</h3>

<p><b>Early Access Fixes</b>: We have recently introduced mechanisms for more rapid updates to the schema.org site, in between official named releases. Prior to 2015, the
schema.org site was only ever updated during official releases (or for occasional emergency repairs such as software bug fixes). In 2015 we introduced
both the hosted extensions mechanism and the notion of "Early Access Fixes" which could be published to schema.org immediately with the agreement of the steering committee.
An "Early Access Fixes" section at the top of the <a href="/docs/releases.html">releases</a> page lists any recently implemented fixes that have occurred
since the most recent release.
</p>

<p>
For versioning purposes the changes are considered part of the subsequent full release.
</p>





<h3>Workflow FAQ</h3>

<p>
This page has a relatively limited audience. Here are some FAQs that go into
greater depth than the main webmaster-focussed <a href="faq.html">schema.org FAQ</a>.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>What are <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/">public-vocabs</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas">W3C WebSchemas</a> group?</dt>
  <dd>When the project launched in 2011 we created a temporary collaborative home for discussions about the project at W3C. This was the
    "Web Schemas" taskforce of the W3C Semantic Web Interest Group. The general names were chosen to reflect the importance of a wide-ranging discussion
    group that looked into how schema.org related to other structured data vocabularies. As W3C's Community Group platform matured and we found
    schema.org discussions were swamping the public-vocabs list, schema.org moved to use instead a dedicated Community Group at W3C. Several
    other groups working on schema.org extensions have subsequently set up their own Community Groups. The public-vocabs mailing list and
    Web Schemas Wiki remain available, but active collaboration on schema.org now uses the
    <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg">new Community Group mailing list</a> alongside <a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/">Github</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt>Where's the plan?</dt>
  <dd>The day to day running of the project is driven by the <a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues">github issue list</a>. This covers new
    vocabulary proposals, modest improvements and fixes for integration, as well as internal software tooling issues. As there are many open issues, some high
    level entry points are available: issues <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1" class="issue-link" title="Meta: schema.org planning">#1</a> (planning), <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2" class="issue-link" title="Proposed vocabulary additions/changes - general rolling overview">#2</a> (vocab changes) and <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3" class="issue-link" title="Meta bug to provide overview of all python/site tool issues">#3</a> (tooling/infrastructure) provide some views into to the various fine-grained issues, as do the labels we attach e.g. <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22type%3Acleanup+%2B+clarity%22">cleanup</a>.
    Generally the project steering group and community prioritize modest (small sized) proposals that maps easily onto structured content that is already widely
    published in the Web, and vocabulary that is likely to be used in large scale projects of all kinds. The project's core emphasis remains public Web
    content but schema.org vocabulary has been used in other settings e.g. structured data in email, and discussions are welcome on new areas where it may prove useful. The
