In some cases, this website may indicate that some but not all of the Sponsors have recognized a particular extension to the Schema; in those cases, as to that extension, the above rights are granted by only those recognizing Sponsors.
</p>

<h2>Changes in Website and Terms and Conditions; Change in Schema</h2>

We may modify or terminate the Website, for any reason, and without notice.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsors agree that no change that we make to these Terms of Service will terminate or modify the license granted under paragraph 1 above with respect to any use or implementation of the Schema occurring prior to the date that the change is published. Please review these Terms of Service from time to time so that you will be apprised of any changes.
The Sponsors reserve the right, at any time, with or without notice to you, to make changes to the Schema, including, without limitation, to make changes that result in your existing Schema content becoming non-compliant with the revised Schema.  The Sponsors shall have no liability to you for any such changes. Each of the Sponsors reserves the right to use, or not use, the Schema in whole or in part, on any or all of its products or services, and no Sponsor shall obligated to index, read or otherwise make use of any Schema content published by you.
