**Schema.org project, proposal for 3-layer model**

Three-Layer Model for Schema.org Process
========================================

The process of development, review, homologate, and the use of tools, databases and sites, must be coupled and compatible.

The core database of the SchemaOrg is simple: is the [`schema_org_rdfa`](http://schema.org/docs/schema_org_rdfa.html) file, and this file can be viewed also as a core dabase.
There are many releases, and  for random access to each release, to each item, is better performed by an simple SQL dabase, like
```SQL
CREATE TABLE schemaorg.definitions ( 
    -- Core table, from split of the released schema_org_rdfa of .
	id serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	rel_id int REFERENCES schemaorg.release(id),	
	label varchar(32) NOT NULL,
	def xml NOT NULL,     -- An XHTML5-RDFa atomic definition structure, 
	              --  any div tag with @typeof and span/@property='rdfs:label'
	modified date,
	UNIQUE(rel_id,label)
);
CREATE TABLE schemaorg.release (   -- any release, past, current or future, stable or for test.
	id serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	rlabel varchar(32) NOT NULL, -- as "stantz", "venkman", etc.	
	versnumber varchar(12),     -- as v1.91, v1.92, etc.
	rdate date,	
	advertise xml,  -- XHTML for http://schema.org/docs/releases.html
	info xml,  		-- aditional contents, as a report with the release technical profile.
	modified date,
	UNIQUE(rlabel)
);
```
So, in the infance of the SchemaOrg we have only a reference file as "core database", and today, more mature, we can represent it into a SQL-database, all the releases. The ideal, in this mature moment, is that all tools undertand the core representation. These tools, and many content generated by them, are mantained in a Github infrastructure. These two operational profiles, characterize two main communities and their scope of work. Summarizing:

* **Trusteeship**: the "core community" (with people from W3C, Google, etc.) not need to "get his hands dirty" with source-code, the main work are decisions about extend vocabulary, use of new technologies, partnership with other iniciatives, etc. They may be democratic, but will be always a minor group, a core, and the main function of this core is to be *trustees* of the database.

* **Technical staff**: all people that like and undertand how work with tools, with Github, etc. and can be representatives of external (non-trustees) and non-technical people... 

And, in the future, if more and more  non-technical people want to colaborate, opine, etc. the ideal model, as showed my Wikipedia and Wikidata, is to offer access to all in a Mediawiki interface. So, "coupling implementation with community" we obtain:

![the 3-layer model](http://xmlfusion.org/etc/modelOf3layer.png)

 1. **Core**  (*layer-1*): SQL controlling RDFa, and only core people, the *Trusteeship*, with power to change the state of this database.
 2. **Distribution** (*layer-2*): Github with all, SQL, Pyton tools, XSLT tools, etc.  use the core data to generate reports, navigation, inferences, search engines, etc. And, perhaps, as community, some people at Github also can manage the proposals, etc.
 3. **Access** (*layer-3*): the *Crowd* needs more simple and objective interface to interact with SchemaOrg. This interface can be *Github Issue pull* for ones, but for most, a kind of Mediawiki interface is better.
